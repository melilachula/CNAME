<h2 id="replacetext">WHO AM I?</h2>
    <p id="replace">Heeeeeeeellooooooo! Trying to figure me out?</p>

<br>

<h3>Early Childhood</h3>

<p>

I've always been a little pervert. I would be in preschool thinking about what I
wanted to do to the little boys in my class and I would love re-watching the only
sex scene in <i>Titanic</i>.

</p>

<br>

<h3>Tweens and Teens</h3>

<p>

I was a fat kid. I was a FUNNY, fat kid. I was your typical class clown from
Pre-K all the way to my senior year in high school. I was so goofy that I never
received any attention from boys. It didn't help that I ended up going to
a private, all-girls, Catholic high school. There, I was known for being an exhibitionist,
flashing my titties in class, showing my pussyfeathers at lunch and walking
around naked. Needless to say, as much as I wanted to be penetrated by the boys
at Cathedral and Salesian, they weren't intrested in the chunky chick. It didn't
help that I didn't conform to the social norms of how a young, "respectable"
girl was supposed to act.
</p>

<p>

HOWEVER, high school eventually got interesting. Going to school with all these
girls helped me get comfortable with myself. I (unfortunately) gave into social
pressure to slim down and dress <i>a la moda</i>; I lost weight, I started
wearing makeup, and I started to slowly "mature" into a sexually available
young woman. Through this process, I graduated a virgin but I was ready to finally
engage in sexual intercourse in my college years.

</p>

<br>

<h3>Becoming a Grown Ass Woman</h3>

<p>

As a brown woman, I have always been sexualized by the hetero-patriarcal society I
live in; in school our skirts had to be a certain length so as not to provoke the
little boys, I was told not to wear red lipstick on the bus because it may be
malinterpreted by men, and during the worst heat my clothes were always policed
to make sure they weren't too "provocative". There came a point where I realized
that this was all bullshit.

</p>

<p>

My sophomore year in college, I got my first real job working at a clothing store
that was known for its "thotty" outfits. As an employee, I had a discount and,
being the fashionista that I am, I indulged in knew clothes. The new me was
starting to reveal herself: I came to the realization that I liked to be sexy,
not for others but for the simple joy of looking at my own reflection. Some may
call it egotistical, I call it REVOLUTIONARY, a big FUCK YOU to this society that
damns you if you're not sexy enough and damns you if you are.

</p>

<p>

I call it a FUCK YOU to the double standard of the gender binary: that
men are expected to be these confident, independent people and the opposite is
expected of women because our capitalist society thrives on our dissatisfication
with ourselves. I call it a FUCK YOU to the notion that men who have multiple
sexual partners are just doing what comes "natural" to them but women who do the
same are not worthy of respect. But you know what, if enjoying sex with many men
makes me a hoe, then so be it, I AM A HOE. But then so are you.
